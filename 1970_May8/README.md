# Ring-tumPhiEXPOSED - 08 May 1970 issue
The repository for the work-in-process and completed Ground Truth Editions of the Ring-tum Phi student newspaper of W&amp;L University.

In addition to the 'v2' enhanced copy of the PDF-format copy of this issue of the 'Ring-tum Phi', we've dumped various work-in-process text files created during the course of this research project.

We currently use the Professional edition of the ABBYY FineReader 12 commercial product for "one-off" layout recognition and text extraction/verification. The directory tree of a 'FineReader document' (being the work-in-process of this OCR application) is huge and of limited use unless you have this commercial product. Although we have not published any FineReader documents here, they are available to fellow reasearchers and historians needing such access.

On behalf of FactMiners and the 'W&L Tall Tales' publication,
Jim "Chico" Salmons (W&L '73)
